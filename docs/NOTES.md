## General Audit
- *Check boxes do not currently do anything
- Selected process should only parse/edit files that are needed (don't parse everything if not)
- If editing only say "project.json", the "optimized" sb3 file returned needs ALL files included.
- Add additional options (disable if Beta/testing)
- Split up main.js into logical "modules"
- Build out code logic for (and test):
  - Optimizing Code Blocks
  - Truncating large comments
  - Removing comments
- Improve function and style of progress bar
  - Move label and percentage to on top of bar
  - Improve look and feel of the progress bar itself
  - Progress bar should show current file being processed
  - Progress bar should be more progressive (not jump arbitrarily)

## Mobile Audit
- Scrolls too much and shows black area on bottom
- Light/Dark icons and padding around it are too big.
